# hello-world
My 1st code repository

Starting with my first repository... actually not the first, but following github guides https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

so let start

I started writing code on 1995, with familiar truck enterprise app for automatizen bill writing, then travel management and finally for logistic management. Code was written in clipper 5.2 and data stored in dbase.

I've written same pieces of SAS statistical code for data managent in forest field

I've also code same pieces for R with similar purpose, forest data management

Now I'm trying to organize and share same of these codes
